# MultiCamera_Nvidia_Jetson_TX2

This project discusses the deployment of an algorithm for face mask recognition, object detection, and distance estimation. The algorithm is executed on the Nvidia Jetson TX2 board with multiple ZED-Cameras. Additionally, it provides an explanation of how to implement this capability using the Cuda DNN module. The primary objective is to offer readers insight into incorporating this functionality into their own projects. Building upon this foundation, upcoming projects can create more intricate and effective algorithms.
